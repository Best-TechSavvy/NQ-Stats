# Navy-Quest-Stats
Hello freinds, 
I play Navy Quest but it hard to play on a phone. 
So I made an informative website make it easier to access information about viechles on Navy Quest.
I am just a 16 year old so I can't just afford web hosting services. Also this project isn't for commercial purposes.
If anybody can help me out please let me know.
Thankfully, github allows public repo to for free pages services. Now github link can be used as back up.
Because github give me a longer link, I will continue to use netilfy side by side.

I have given both link bellow, use them as you like!

Here is the link for the website that I created:

This site is powered by Netlify, if you want to know more about it please visit netlify.com.

Here is the github link.
