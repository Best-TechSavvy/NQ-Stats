# Navy-Quest-Stats
Hello friends! 👋
I play Navy Quest, but I find it hard to play on a phone. So, I created an informative website to make it easier to access details about vehicles in Navy Quest.
Thankfully, GitHub allows free public repositories with Pages services, so I’ve added a backup version of the site there. Since GitHub gives a longer link, I’ll continue using Netlify side by side for convenience.
Feel free to use whichever link works best for you!

Click the "Add Vehicle" button.
Fill out the form with accurate information about the vehicle.
