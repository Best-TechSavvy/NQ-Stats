# Navy-Quest-Stats
Hello friends! 👋
I play Navy Quest, but I find it hard to play on a phone. So, I created an informative website to make it easier to access details about vehicles in Navy Quest.
Thankfully, GitHub allows free public repositories with Pages services, so I’ve added a backup version of the site there. Since GitHub gives a longer link, I’ll continue using Netlify side by side for convenience.
Feel free to use whichever link works best for you!
